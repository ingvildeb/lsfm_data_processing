# NIFTI TO 2D CORONAL TIFF SLICES
# ================================

# Convert a 3D downsampled LSFM NIfTI volume into 2D coronal TIFF slices.
# These slices are typically used as input for manual / ilastik brain-mask labeling.

# Copy this file, rename to:
# 1_nii_to_2D_files_local.toml
# and edit values there.

# -------- INPUT --------
# Path to your raw NIfTI volume file
nifti_file = "Z:/LSFM/your_experiment/ch2_iso20um.nii.gz"

# -------- OUTPUT --------
# Output folder (created next to nifti_file) and filename pattern
output_folder_name = "2D_for_mask_generation"
output_prefix = "slice"
