# ================================
# ILASTIK 2D SEGMENTATION TO 3D NIFTI MASK
# ================================

# Reconstruct a 3D binary mask volume from ilastik-exported 2D segmentation images.
# Intended to run after creating coronal slices with 1_nii_to_2D_files.py.

# Copy this file, rename to:
# 2_2D_to_nii_mask_local.toml
# and edit values there.

# -------- INPUT --------
# Folder containing ilastik segmentation outputs
segmentation_dir = "Z:/LSFM/your_experiment/2D_for_mask_generation"

# -------- FILE NAMING --------
output_nifti_name = "segmented_volume.nii.gz"
slice_prefix = "slice"
segmentation_suffix = "_Simple Segmentation.png"

# -------- LABEL MAPPING --------
# Pixel label value to treat as brain / foreground in the binary output mask
foreground_label = 1
