# ================================
# DILATE, FILL, AND SMOOTH BINARY MASK
# ================================

# Post-process a binary segmentation mask by:
# 1) dilation,
# 2) hole filling,
# 3) gaussian smoothing + thresholding back to binary.
# This is useful to close small holes and preserve edges before applying the mask.

# Copy this file, rename to:
# 3_dilate_and_fill_mask_local.toml
# and edit values there.
