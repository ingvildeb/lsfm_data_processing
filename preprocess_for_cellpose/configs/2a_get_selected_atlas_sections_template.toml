# GET SELECTED ATLAS SECTIONS
# ================================

# Extract atlas sections corresponding to your selected sections (from step 2)
# Requires that ANTs registration has been performed

# Copy this file and rename to:
# 2a_get_selected_atlas_sections_local.toml
# and edit values there.

# -------- SAMPLE PATHS --------
# Paths to the LSFM sample folders
# Folders must have a registration subfolder named _01_registration,
# with a file called ANTs_TransformedImage.nii.gz being the warped label volume

# Path to the folder containing images selected using 2_select_representative_sections

# -------- ADVANCED SETTINGS --------

# increment in your file number indices. 
# Used to be 20 for older LifeCanvas data but recently changed to 10. Check your original (non-MIP) images to be sure.
